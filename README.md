# Threats Manager Platform Engine Core libraries and SDK

## Definition

Threats Manager Platform is a Threat Modeling solution that has been designed to be rehostable, extendable and flexible.
It has been designed and implemented by a group of experienced Threat Modelers, to satisfy the needs of their day by day job, and it has been evolved over the time to cover additional scenarios.
Threats Manager Platform is the reference implementation of the Threat Modeling vNext vision, discussed in <https://simoneonsecurity.com>.

The code included in this Repo is to be also available as part of a complete Threat Modeling tool, called Threats Manager Studio, which implements the Windows Desktop experience. That tool along with a number of Extensions will be published soon.
Threats Manager Studio and the Windows Desktop Extensions will not be available as Open Source, because they are based on various commercial components. Still, they will be freely downloadable and usable in all contexts, under a very permissive license. 
It will be provided both as a reference implementation of Threats Manager Platform and as a tool you can adopt for your Threat Modeling activities.
